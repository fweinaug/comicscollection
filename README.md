# Comics Collection

Backend and RESTful API to manage a comic collection, built with [Yii2](https://www.yiiframework.com/).

With the backend you can create, edit and delete comics, issues, publishers and creators.
It has a simple design but provides a couple of features to make managing the collection as easy as possible.

The API is used by a [Flutter app to browse the collection](https://github.com/fweinaug/comicscollection-app).
